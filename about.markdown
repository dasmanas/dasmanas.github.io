As a passionate and innovative software engineer, I thrive on solving complex problems that drive technological advancements. With a strong foundation in Computer Science, mathematics, and statistics, and a love for cutting-edge technologies, I continuously strive to stay on top of the ever-evolving technology landscape.

Throughout my career, I have been hands-on in developing applications using Java, Scala, Rust, Python, and JavaScript. I possess extensive experience in developing solutions across various domains, including Peer-to-Peer networking systems, Search & Match systems, building highly scalable distributed platforms for large-scale datasets (Big Data), and creating end-user facing web applications and APIs for diverse industry sectors such as Banking, Credit Bureau, Healthcare Business Services, Software Life Cycle & Supply Chain, and Software Security and Governance.

I am technology-focused, highly motivated, and possess excellent problem-solving skills. I am a result-driven engineer with a keen eye for details, and I embark on a journey where data becomes my trusted ally.
