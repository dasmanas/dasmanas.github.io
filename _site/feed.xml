If it is there, we can find it using Depth First Traversal Technique. In a recursive call, if we keep track of visited nodes, we will able to identify if there is any cycle exist. But in landscape of large scale data using DFS could be challenging as we have to keep maininting the visited nodes array and need to pass to the next node. It might cause a high memory overhead to the solution. The task could be solved in a bit different approach using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocha–Thatte_cycle_detection_algorithm">Rocha–Thatte cycle detection algorithm</a>.</p>

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
